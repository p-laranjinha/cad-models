# Klavgen switch holders
I took the switch holder CadQuery generation code from https://github.com/klavgen/klavgen and translated it to build123d, my prefered code CAD library.
Additionally, I made some small changes in `main.py` to make a switch grab to the holder better.

Also included an image from the original repository so I can see where the wires are supposed to go.
